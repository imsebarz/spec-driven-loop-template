# Spec-Driven Loop Template

A polished public starter for **spec-driven development (SDD)** with a lightweight autonomous loop (`ralph.sh`).

This template is built for teams and solo builders who want agents to work from **specs first**, keep a **living implementation plan**, and ship in **small verified increments**.

## Why this exists

Most agent workflows break down in one of two ways:

1. the agent starts coding before the product is specified
2. the plan drifts and nobody knows what is actually left

This template fixes that by making four files first-class:

- `specs/*` → product and technical truth
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` → prioritized remaining work
- `PROMPT_plan.md` → planning/audit loop
- `PROMPT_build.md` → implementation loop

## What’s included

- **Ralph Loop** (`ralph.sh`)
- **Planning prompt** for reconciling specs, code, and roadmap
- **Build prompt** for incremental implementation with tests
- **Implementation plan** skeleton
- **Operational guide** (`AGENTS.md`)
- **Starter specs**
- **MIT license**
- **Contributing guide**

## Philosophy

### 1. Specs are the source of truth
The loop should derive work from `specs/*`, not from vibes.

### 2. The plan is durable state
If the agent crashes, times out, or loses context, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` is the recovery surface.

### 3. Small complete increments beat giant partials
The ideal build iteration:
- chooses one high-priority task
- implements it completely
- runs the required tests
- updates the plan
- commits the result

### 4. Tests verify outcomes, not implementation style
Each task in the plan should define what success looks like from the acceptance criteria.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- `git`
- `bash`
- one coding agent CLI:
  - `claude`
  - or `codex`

### 1. Clone and enter the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/imsebarz/spec-driven-loop-template.git my-app
cd my-app
```

### 2. Customize the specs
Edit `specs/*` until they actually describe your product.

### 3. Run a planning pass
```bash
./ralph.sh plan 1
```

Expected result:
- specs reviewed
- source tree inspected
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` updated
- tasks prioritized
- verification outcomes clarified

### 4. Run build iterations
```bash
./ralph.sh build 5
```

Or with Codex:
```bash
./ralph.sh --agent codex build 5
```

Expected result:
- the top task is selected
- implementation happens in code, not just in docs
- required tests run
- the plan is updated
- completed work is committed

## Suggested cadence

### Planning loop
Use when:
- specs changed
- the repo drifted
- the plan feels stale
- the next task is unclear

```bash
./ralph.sh plan 1
```

### Build loop
Use when:
- the plan is already sane
- you want execution
- you want several incremental turns

```bash
./ralph.sh build 8
```

## Ralph loop behavior

The included `ralph.sh` is intentionally simple but practical.

It supports:
- `plan` mode
- `build` mode
- `claude` or `codex`
- iteration limits
- per-iteration logs in `.ralph-logs/`

It also includes a small amount of resilience:
- keeps logs for every iteration
- can auto-commit tiny interrupted changes
- can stash larger interrupted work
- helps future iterations recover from dirty state

## Example commands

```bash
# one planning pass
./ralph.sh plan 1

# five implementation iterations with Claude
./ralph.sh build 5

# eight implementation iterations with Codex
./ralph.sh --agent codex build 8
```

## Recommended spec set

These starter files are enough to begin:

- `01-architecture.md`
- `02-data-model.md`
- `10-ui-design.md`
- `15-mvp-scope.md`

Useful next additions:
- auth
- sync model
- error handling
- deployment model
- testing strategy

## Good usage patterns

### Do
- keep specs concrete
- keep the plan prioritized
- derive tests from acceptance criteria
- prefer shared modules over app-local duplication
- commit after meaningful increments

### Don’t
- let the loop code against an empty spec set
- leave placeholder scripts forever
- mix operational instructions into the product specs
- treat the plan as a status diary instead of a roadmap

## Making it your own

You’ll probably want to customize:
- commit scopes in `AGENTS.md`
- prompts in `PROMPT_plan.md` / `PROMPT_build.md`
- loop behavior in `ralph.sh`
- starter spec files for your product domain
